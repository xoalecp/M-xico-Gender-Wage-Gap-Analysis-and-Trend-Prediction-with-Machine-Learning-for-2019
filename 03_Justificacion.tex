\subsubsection{Scope}
Energy efficiency has developed into an important objective for industrial enterprises. However, there is still a need for systematic approaches to reduce energy consumption in factories. From an economic point of view, industrial enterprises have an incentive to reduce their energy consumption because of increasing energy prices, such as the European average prices for gas in industry, which rose by approximately 34\% during the last four years \cite{European2013}. 
Despite this situation, the implementation of energy efficiency measures has not met the expectations yet. The reasons for the deficits in realizing energy efficiency include lack of time, lacking transparency on energy consumption, lacking capital for investments and divided responsibilities within a company \cite{Fleiter2013}.
