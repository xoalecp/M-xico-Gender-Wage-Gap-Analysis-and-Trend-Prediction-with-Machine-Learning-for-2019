The integrating energy efficiency performance in production management, gap analysis between industrial needs and scientific literature. Manufacturing companies need greater capabilities to respond more quicker \cite{Ghani2012} to market dynamics and varying demands. It is obvious that energy efficiency becomes a driver for manufacturing industry, since it has become one of the greatest energy consumers and carbon emitters in the World, higher than transportation, residential and commercial usage.
